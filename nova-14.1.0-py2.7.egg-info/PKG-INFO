        To learn how to use Nova's API, consult the documentation
        available online at:

        Operators
        ---------
        
        To learn how to deploy and configure OpenStack Nova, consult the
        documentation available online at:
        
            http://docs.openstack.org
        
        For information about the different compute (hypervisor) drivers
        supported by Nova, please read:
        
           http://docs.openstack.org/developer/nova/feature_classification.html
        
        In the unfortunate event that bugs are discovered, they should
        be reported to the appropriate bug tracker. If you obtained
        the software from a 3rd party operating system vendor, it is
        often wise to use their own bug tracker for reporting problems.
        In all other cases use the master OpenStack bug tracker,
        available at:
        
           http://bugs.launchpad.net/nova
